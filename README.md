## Quick start

1.  **Start developing.**

    ```shell
    gatsby develop
    ```

2.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data.
